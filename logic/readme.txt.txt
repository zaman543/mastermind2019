How to play mastermind:

The game chooses a random sequence (size 6) of non-repeating colors from a pool of 10 colors. The user
attemps to guess this combination by clicking on the colored squares. These squares show up on the right grid, and
when the combination is done, the corresponding left grid lights up black if the color is in the right spot and was chosen,
it lights up white if the color is in the combination but in the wrong spot. The game continues until the total amount
of tries if taken up, the user guesses the combination, or the user hits the give up button.
